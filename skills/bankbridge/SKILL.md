description: Answer questions about the user's own money (balances, spending, subscriptions, cashflow, bills, investments, taxes) with live, read-only data from their connected US banks, cards and brokerages through the BankBridge MCP server. Use when the user asks how much they spent, what they pay for, whether they are saving, where a charge came from, or how their portfolio is doing.

# BankBridge: questions about the user's real accounts

BankBridge is a remote MCP server at `https://bankbridge.money/api/mcp` that gives you read-only access to the user's connected bank, credit card and brokerage accounts. Every tool call fetches live data from the bank. Nothing can move money, pay a bill or place a trade.

## Setup

- If the BankBridge tools (`list_accounts`, `list_transactions`, ...) are not available, the user connects once: in Claude, add BankBridge from the Connectors Directory (https://claude.ai/directory/connectors/bankbridge) or this plugin's Connectors tab; in Claude Code, run `/mcp` and sign in. Other agents: https://bankbridge.money/docs
- If a result says `setup_required` or has a NO_CONNECTIONS notice, show the user the link in the result. It finishes the subscription or connects a bank. Pricing is $5 a month per connected bank, or $50 a year.

## Which tool for which question

| Question | Tool |
|---|---|
| Balances, account list, credit utilization | `list_accounts`, `get_account` |
| "How much did I spend on X?" | `get_spending_summary` (group by category, merchant, month or week) |
| Find a specific charge or merchant | `search_transactions`, then `get_merchant_history` |
| Subscriptions and bills | `get_recurring_charges` |
| "Am I making more than I spend?" | `get_monthly_cashflow` (one call per month, `month: "YYYY-MM"`) |
| Raw transactions with filters | `list_transactions` (date range, amount, category, account; paginate with `offset`) |
| Category names to filter by | `list_categories` |
| Portfolio, gains, dividends | `list_holdings`, `list_investment_transactions` |
| Add another bank | `connect_bank` (returns a link for the user) |

## Reading the data correctly

- Amounts are dollars. Positive = money leaving the account (spending). Negative = money coming in (income, refunds).
- Credit card payments from checking are not new spending: the purchases already appear on the card. Leave them out of spending totals.
- Transfers between the user's own accounts are not spending either. Transfers to other people (rent to a landlord, for example) are.
- One subscription can appear under several descriptor spellings. Check `get_merchant_history` before calling two charges duplicates.
- Don't project a year from one month. Use at least three months for averages, and say when a category is seasonal (utilities, travel).
- Every result has a `warnings` array. If it is not empty, tell the user (for example, a bank that needs reconnecting, with its reconnect link) and say the totals cover only the banks that answered.

## Good habits

- Start a session with `list_accounts` so you know which accounts exist; account ids can change when a bank is reconnected, so don't reuse old ids.
- Answer with the numbers first, then the detail: totals, the biggest items, and the change versus the previous period.
- Keep the user's data in the conversation. Don't paste it into other tools or services unless the user asks.
