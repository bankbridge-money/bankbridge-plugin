# BankBridge for Claude

BankBridge is a remote MCP server that lets Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor and other AI agents read your bank accounts, credit cards and investments. Ask "how much did I spend on restaurants last month?" or "what subscriptions am I paying for?" and get answers from live data. Read-only, US banks, $5 a month per connected bank.

**Works with:** Claude (claude.ai, Desktop, mobile, Cowork), Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf and any MCP client.

More to ask: *"find any subscriptions I've forgotten about"*, *"draft a budget from my actual last 3 months"*, *"am I making more than I spend?"* One account covers every bank you connect.

## Install

### Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Claude mobile, Cowork

BankBridge is in the [Claude Connectors Directory](https://claude.ai/directory/connectors/bankbridge). Open the listing, click **Connect**, sign in to BankBridge. No key to paste. Connectors sync across every Claude app, and Claude Code picks them up too.

### Claude Code (plugin, with 19 slash commands)

```shell
/plugin marketplace add bankbridge-money/bankbridge-plugin
/plugin install bankbridge
```

The first time a command runs, run `/mcp` and sign in to BankBridge in your browser. No key to paste. (Before version 0.4.0 the plugin asked for an API token; it now signs in the same way as the Claude connector.)

The same plugin is listed for claude.ai chat and Cowork, where the 19 commands load as skills and the server is connected from the plugin's **Connectors** tab.

Prefer no plugin and no key? One command, then `/mcp` to sign in through your browser:

```shell
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http bankbridge https://bankbridge.money/api/mcp
```

### Cursor, VS Code (Copilot)

Use the **Add to Cursor** or **Install in VS Code** badge above. The editor asks you to confirm, then opens the BankBridge sign-in page in your browser. No key to paste.

### Gemini CLI, Codex CLI

```shell
gemini mcp add --scope user --transport http bankbridge https://bankbridge.money/api/mcp
codex mcp add bankbridge --url https://bankbridge.money/api/mcp
```

Both discover BankBridge&rsquo;s OAuth sign-in automatically (Gemini: run `/mcp auth bankbridge`; Codex opens the browser on its own).

### Everything else

Server URL: `https://bankbridge.money/api/mcp` (Streamable HTTP). Auth: OAuth 2.1 with Dynamic Client Registration, or `Authorization: Bearer bbk_...` with a key from your dashboard. Step-by-step guides for each agent: [bankbridge.money/docs](https://bankbridge.money/docs?ref=github).

You&rsquo;ll need:
- **A BankBridge account**: [sign up](https://bankbridge.money/?ref=github) ($5/mo or $50/yr per connected bank), or try the demo with sample data from the sign-in screen, no signup
- **At least one bank connected**: linked on the dashboard in ~30 seconds

## Install the skill in any agent

[![skills.sh](https://img.shields.io/badge/skills.sh-bankbridge-111111?style=flat-square)](https://skills.sh/bankbridge-money/bankbridge-plugin/bankbridge)

```shell
npx skills add bankbridge-money/bankbridge-plugin        # this project (asks which agents)
npx skills add bankbridge-money/bankbridge-plugin -g     # user-level, every project
```

Where the skill lands (to install by hand, copy `skills/bankbridge/` there):

| Agent | Project folder | User folder (`-g`) |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/bankbridge/` | `~/.claude/skills/bankbridge/` |
| Codex | `.agents/skills/bankbridge/` | `~/.codex/skills/bankbridge/` |
| Cursor | `.agents/skills/bankbridge/` | `~/.cursor/skills/bankbridge/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.agents/skills/bankbridge/` | `~/.copilot/skills/bankbridge/` |
| Gemini CLI | `.agents/skills/bankbridge/` | `~/.gemini/skills/bankbridge/` |
| OpenCode | `.agents/skills/bankbridge/` | `~/.config/opencode/skills/bankbridge/` |
| Cline | `.agents/skills/bankbridge/` | `~/.agents/skills/bankbridge/` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/skills/bankbridge/` | `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/bankbridge/` |
| Goose | `.goose/skills/bankbridge/` | `~/.config/goose/skills/bankbridge/` |
| OpenClaw | `skills/bankbridge/` | `~/.openclaw/skills/bankbridge/` |

The skill tells your agent when and how to use BankBridge; the MCP server does the work, so connect that too (see Install above).

## 19 slash commands, included

Type `/` in any Claude Code session to find them. Each wraps a multi-step flow with an opinionated output shape, so you don&rsquo;t have to hand-craft the prompt.

> **Also in Claude iOS / Android / Desktop / Cowork.** The same 19 commands are exposed as MCP prompts, so they appear under the **+** button in the chat input bar. One tap fills the full prompt. In Cursor, ChatGPT, and other MCP clients, they show up in whatever prompt-picker UI that client provides.

## Under the hood: 12 MCP tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_accounts` | All connected bank accounts with current balances |
| `get_account` | Detail lookup for one account by id |
| `list_transactions` | Filter by date range, amount, category, account, pending flag |
| `search_transactions` | Substring match on merchant name + description |
| `get_spending_summary` | Group spending by category / merchant / month / week |
| `get_recurring_charges` | Detected subscriptions with merchant, amount, frequency |
| `get_monthly_cashflow` | Income vs expenses for a given month, top sources |
| `get_merchant_history` | Full charge history for a merchant with stats |
| `list_categories` | Spending categories present in your data |
| `list_holdings` | Current investment positions with gain/loss |
| `list_investment_transactions` | Buys, sells, dividends, fees |
| `connect_bank` | Deep-link into a bank-connect flow when no banks are connected |

All **read-only**. BankBridge literally can&rsquo;t move money, change passwords, or make trades.

## Privacy & security

Your transactions never touch our servers. **We never store them.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **We don&rsquo;t keep your data** | Every question your agent asks live-fetches in real time. No transaction cache, and no record of what you asked or what came back. |
| **Read-only access** | Your agent can read balances and transactions. Nothing can move money, pay a bill, or change your accounts. |
| **Bank-grade encryption** | AES-256-GCM for access tokens at rest. HTTPS everywhere. |
| **Revocable right away** | Disconnect a bank or delete your account anytime, and the connection is revoked and deleted right away. |
| **Trusted banking rails** | Same infrastructure Venmo and Robinhood rely on. |

BankBridge re-fetches on every question instead of caching your financial history. Details: [bankbridge.money/security](https://bankbridge.money/security?ref=github).

## Pricing

**$5/month per connected bank, or $50/year per bank.** First bank unlocks the service. Each additional bank adds $5/mo, prorated when you connect it. Cancel anytime, access ends at the end of your billing period.

No free tier, no freemium, no trial. Just $5 per bank. It&rsquo;s fair, predictable, and means we&rsquo;re never tempted to monetize your data. We&rsquo;re a real subscription business.
